me when i steal whos-evan's code, and just remove the frontend bc idk how to make one myself\
sorry, but i needed a stealthier proxy.\
you are welcome to skid this, just credit pls.\
i'm a skidder myself, so do as you please. \
credit will be helpful, i want to see others use my work for more than games \
credits will go to 3kh0 for the games, ihtasham42 for Progress Knight, Landgreen for N-Gon, Whos-Evan for the baseline shit (yea not optimal but idgaf), and Titanium Network for Ultraviolet.
